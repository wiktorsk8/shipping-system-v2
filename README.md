This project is basicly a playground for learning Laravel and practising various design patterns.

Application is using Google API to convert address into coordinates, and calculate the shortest route to collect all packages in a given area. I also implemented simple CRUD for Package and Address model. The main goal for this project was to work with third-party API, implement DTO's and Repository patterns.
